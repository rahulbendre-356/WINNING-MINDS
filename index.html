                <h2>RULES FOR FOOTBALL</h2>
                <p>☉Number of Players:
                    Each team consists of 11 players on the field, including one goalkeeper.
                    A match cannot start or continue if a team has fewer than 7 players.</p>
                    <p>☉Duration of the Match:
                        A standard football match is 90 minutes long, divided into two halves of 45 minutes each.
                        There is a 15-minute halftime break.
                        If needed, additional time (extra time) and penalty shootouts may occur.</p>
                        <p>☉The Objective:
                            The goal is to score more goals than the opponent by getting the ball into the opponent’s goalpost.
                            A goal is scored when the entire ball crosses the goal line between the goalposts and beneath the crossbar.</p>
                            <p>☉Ball in and Out of Play:
                                The ball is out of play when it has fully crossed the goal line or touchline, either on the ground or in the air.
                                The ball is in play at all other times, including when it rebounds from a goalpost or referee.</p>
                                <p>☉Offside Rule:
                                    A player is considered offside if they are closer to the opponent’s goal than both the ball and the second-last defender when the ball is passed to them.
                                    A player in an offside position is only penalized if they are actively involved in the play.</p>

                                The batting team tries to score runs, while the bowling team aims to dismiss the batsmen.</p>

                <p>☉Number of Players:
                    Each team has 5 players on the court at a time. Teams also have substitute players who can replace players during play.</p>

    <h2>Employment Reservations</h2>
    <p>The Government of India offers employment reservations to athletes through various schemes and policies aimed at providing stable career opportunities in both public and private sectors. These reservations are designed to support athletes who have represented the country at state, national, and international levels, ensuring that they are not only recognized for their contributions to sports but also have access to meaningful employment. Below are the details of employment reservations provided to athletes:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Reserved Positions in Government Jobs:</strong> Athletes who have participated in national and international competitions are eligible for reserved positions in various government departments. The central government, as well as many state governments, set aside a specific percentage of job vacancies under the sports quota. These positions are available in sectors such as public administration, defense, police services, and public sector undertakings (PSUs). Athletes are given priority during the recruitment process, ensuring that their sporting achievements are recognized and rewarded with stable employment opportunities.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Relaxation in Eligibility Criteria:</strong> To facilitate easier access to government jobs, athletes are often granted relaxation in age limits, educational qualifications, and physical standards during recruitment. This enables athletes to apply for jobs that they may otherwise not qualify for due to their sports-related commitments. For example, certain posts in the defense and police forces offer age relaxation and physical requirement exemptions for eligible athletes.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Priority in Recruitment Drives:</strong> During recruitment drives for public sector jobs, athletes are given priority under the sports quota. Special interviews and recruitment tests are conducted for athletes, ensuring that their sporting accomplishments are taken into account when assessing their qualifications for the job. Athletes who have represented the country in events like the Olympics, Asian Games, or Commonwealth Games often receive direct recruitment offers for prestigious positions in government organizations.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Employment in Public Sector Undertakings (PSUs):</strong> Many PSUs, such as Indian Railways, ONGC, SAIL, and others, reserve positions for athletes under the sports quota. These organizations offer attractive career paths and provide opportunities for athletes to continue participating in sports while being employed. Athletes are often recruited as sports officers, coaches, or team managers within these organizations, allowing them to contribute to the development of sports in India while pursuing a professional career.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Job Security and Career Advancement:</strong> Athletes employed under the sports quota enjoy job security, which is crucial for those transitioning from a career in sports to a professional career. Many government departments and PSUs also provide opportunities for career advancement through promotions, based on both professional performance and continued participation in sports. This ensures that athletes can grow within their chosen fields while maintaining their association with sports.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Special Provisions for Armed Forces and Police Services:</strong> The Indian Armed Forces and police departments have specific provisions for recruiting athletes under the sports quota. Athletes are often recruited as officers in the army, navy, air force, and paramilitary forces, where they receive both military training and the opportunity to represent the country in national and international sporting events. Similarly, police forces recruit athletes for roles in physical training, sports management, and competition teams.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>In addition to these benefits, athletes employed under the sports quota may also receive additional support, such as flexible working hours, leaves of absence for training and competitions, and financial incentives for outstanding performance in sports. These provisions ensure that athletes can continue to train and compete while maintaining their professional careers.</p>
